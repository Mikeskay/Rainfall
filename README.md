# Task Description: 
Implement a YearlyRainfall class that defines an array attribute of
twelve integers to hold the monthly rainfall values for a single year.

Its public methods should be implemented as follows:

• getMonthAmount – takes a single integer argument (within the index bounds
of the array attribute: 0 for January etc) and returns the integer rainfall amount
for that month. Return –1 for an invalid month.

• setMonthAmount – takes an integer argument as the month and a second
integer argument representing the rainfall value to be set for that particular
month. The method should set the rainfall figure for the given month to the
given value. Do nothing for an invalid month or amount.

• getMean – takes no argument and returns the mean monthly value for the
whole year (the sum of the individual monthly values, divided by the number of
months). The result should be returned as a double.
